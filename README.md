**About Me** <br>
Spoiled brat, going for self-employed.
<br><br>

**Currently working on/with**:
- A time management Android App (Kotlin + Hilt + Compose + Room. IDE: Android Studio)

Not giving specifics because you're probably able to code faster than me and then you'd steal my ideas and implement them before I can do it üôÑ
<br><br>

**Current main programming languages**:
- Kotlin

**Other programming languages I've used with some consistency in the past, sorted from "most competent with" to "least competent with"**:
- Java 
 <br>(high school classes and small personal projects)
- C# 
 <br>(WPF and .Net \[NOT core\] in particular, small personal projects)
- Pascal 
 <br>(high school classes and a stupid console program that made the internal speaker beep the Super Mario theme \[P.S: I wish internal speakers were still around üò¢Ô∏è\])
- Python 
 <br>(high school classes)
- Visual Basic 
 <br>(high school classes)
- Assembly 
 <br>(high school classes)

**Programming languages I've barely touched, sorted from "barely competent with" to "how do you use this thing again?"**:
- Javascript 
 <br>(hate it, this language is pure insanity and if you like it you're either a psycopath or have anti-social personality disorder, I'm fully convinced of this)
- C++
- C
- F#
- PHP
