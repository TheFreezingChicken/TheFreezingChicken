**About Me** <br>
Spoiled brat.
<br><br>


**Programming languages I've used or are using with some consistency, sorted from "most competent with" to "least competent with"**:
- Kotlin<br>
(Personal projects)
- Java<br>
(High school classes and small personal projects)
- Javascript 
 <br>(Personal projects, hate it. This language is pure insanity and if you like it you're either a psycopath or have anti-social personality disorder, I'm fully convinced of this.)
- C# 
 <br>(WPF and .Net \[NOT core\] in particular, small personal projects)
- Pascal 
 <br>(high school classes and a stupid console program that made the internal speaker beep the Super Mario theme \[P.S: I wish internal speakers were still around üò¢Ô∏è\])
- Python 
 <br>(high school classes)
- Visual Basic 
 <br>(high school classes)
- Assembly 
 <br>(high school classes)

**Programming languages I've barely touched, sorted from "barely competent with" to "how do you use this thing again?"**:
- C++
- C
- F#
- PHP
