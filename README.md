**About Me** <br>
Spoiled brat, going for self-employed.
<br><br>

**Currently working on/with**:
- A time management Android App (Kotlin + Hilt + Compose + Room)

Not giving specifics because you're probably able to code faster than me and then you'd steal my ideas and implement them before I can do it ðŸ™„
<br><br>

**Current main programming languages**:
- Kotlin

**Other programming languages I've used for a long period in the past**:
- Java
- C# (WPF, .Net)
- Pascal
- Assembly
- Python
- Visual Basic

**Programming languages I've barely touched**:
- C++
- C
- F#
- PHP
- Javascript (hate it, this language is pure insanity and if you like it you're either a psycopath or have anti-social personality disorder, I'm fully convinced of this)
